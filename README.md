# SSDMobileNet_CoreML
Real-time object-detection using SSD on Mobilenet, exported using tf-coreml

- I used some of hollance convenient methods for object-detection (https://github.com/hollance/CoreMLHelpers), NMS/IoU/etc.
- The code for box-decoding from MobileNetV1-features was implemented by Vincent Chu (https://github.com/vincentchu).
