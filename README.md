# SSDMobileNet_CoreML
Real-time object-detection on iOS using CoreML model of SSD based on Mobilenet. This project contains an example-project for running real-time inference of that model on iOS.

- CoreML-file created following the example https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml/blob/master/examples/ssd_example.ipynb
- I used some of hollance convenient methods for object-detection (https://github.com/hollance/CoreMLHelpers), NMS/IoU/etc.
- The code for box-decoding from MobileNetV1-features was implemented by Vincent Chu (https://github.com/vincentchu).
